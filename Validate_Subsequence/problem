  Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
  whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

  A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
  in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
  instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] , and so do the numbers [2, 4]
